# K--SubSpaces-and-Anomaly-Detection
The repository contains part of my project for the course:
Selected Topics in Images Processing, [Prof. Stanley Rotman](http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~srotman/)

cool image

The goal of the project is to implement the k-SubSpaces algorithm, use it as a pre-processing tool for to anomaly detection (primarily the RX algorithm) in hyperspecteral images, 
and compare it to k-means algorithm as a pre-processing tool for to anomaly detection.  

The diffrence between the 2 algorithms is in the use of high dimentinal data.

## Repo Usage
This project was mostly based on implementing the 2 algorithms, running multiple experiments and performing exploratory data analysis. These are organized in the following folders:
- [docs](docs): Contains the full project report as well as a presentation (for quick read)
- [code](code): Contains the experiments (.m, .mlx), functions (.m) and scripts (.m) used in the project.

## Datasets Used
The data used for this project can be found here:
[RIT Target Detection Blind Test](http://dirsapps.cis.rit.edu/blindtest/)
 
Hyperspectral Toolbox for MATLAB (contains useful operators, transformations and algorithms):
[HyperToolbox](https://github.com/isaacgerg/matlabHyperspectralToolbox)
